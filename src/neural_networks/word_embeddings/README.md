# Word Embeddings

This folder contains the pretrained word embeddings that can be used for the training of the Neural Network models.

Each line of the pretrained word embedding should have the following format:

> `word    float_1    float_2    ...    float_N`

where *N* is the dimension of the word embedding.

Each element is divided by a *tabulation*.

An example of word embedding is available in `word_embedding_sample.tsv`.
